## Steps to build a feature

This is how I prefer to build a feature

## Step 1: Define the problem - what is that I want this very specific feature to solve: 

This is because if I have a very clear problem statement I clarify what value the feature is bringing to the user.

The problem statement should be very simple, no more than one line.

### Step 2: Write the user story

Take the problem statement and make use of it in the user story, but turn it into a solution.

The purpose of this is to put my self into the perspective of the user.

Problem statement and the user story needs to fit together.

This is to make sure that I am solving the users problem and not my own problem.

### Step 3: Draw a LO-FI

This important to clarify what the feature should look like and also to stay in scope. 
If I am working in a team it also helps making sure that everyone is working towards the same end result.

### Step 4: Split the User into tasks (and add possible chores if needed)

This helps breaking the ice and getting started. In the beginning can be hard to imagine every task needed if I am working on something new to me but otherwise the tasks shall when completed one at a time lead to a finished feature.

### Step 5 start with writing a test 

The test is a to do list. Write what I can but otherwise start small. 

### Step 6: Write some pseudo code.

This is also to break the ice and get started. If need be use it for the test as well

### Step 7: Write code

Write the code I can, then start over from step 5. 

### Step 8: Go back and start over from step 1
This is to stay in scope. Make changes if needed.


### Step 9: Ask for input from someone not working on the feature.

This helps staying in scope. Am I actually making sense, writing the rights in a great way.

### Step 10: Connect the backend and the frontend
Otherwise you might too late realise that your feature doesn't work with the rest of your code.

### Step 11: Make a real, non-technical, not introduced user try using the application without prior introduction.
This is again to make sure that what I am building actually makes sense to the one that is supposed to use it.

### Extra note for when working in teams:
Express your opinion. Clearly state what you think. Admit if you make a mistake. Be honest if you disagree.
Admit what I don't know. Stay positive.
